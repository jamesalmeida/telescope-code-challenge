# Telescope Code Challenge

Simple app using data from https://stateapi-test.votenow.tv/widgets/get?wid=31204006f9270601

### Run it locally
```
> git clone git@github.com:jamesalmeida/telescope-code-challenge.git
> cd telescope-code-challenge
> npm install
> npm start
```

### Notes
- Facebook's API requires the URL to use HTTPS but when running locally it won't have a proper certificate. Your browser will most likely warn you the page is insecure. You'll have to choose the option to load it anyways to get past that when you first load the app and log in through Facebooks API.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
